 INCUBED (in3) is a minimal verification client for blockchain networks, this version of in3 is written in C. 
 
 Most blockchains, such as Ethereum, require a client to connect to their blockchain network. Often, these clients 
 require a very high bandwidth or constant computation. While this is possible to perform on laptops or desktop systems, 
 mobile devices struggle to meet these requirements. Currently the solution of choice is to use a light client on mobile 
 devices. While this works for mobile phones, most IoT devices are unable to run light clients. Connecting an IoT device 
 to a remote node enables even low-performance IoT devices to be connected to blockchain. However, by using distinct 
 remote nodes the advantages of a decentralized network are undermined introducing a single point of failure.
 The Trustless Incentivized Remote Node Network, in short INCUBED, would make it possible to establish a 
 decentralized and secure network of remote nodes, enabling trustworthy and fast access to blockchain for a large number 
 of low-performance IoT and mobile devices.

 ## Example 
 
 Please have a look at the examples folder in the repo for more detailed [examples](https://github.com/slockit/in3-c/tree/master/examples). 
 
 ### CLI
  in3 can be used on the command line in this manner: 
  
  ```in3 [options] method [arguments]```
  
  For example,
  
  To get block number, run: 
  ```
  > in3 eth_blockNumber
  8610795
  ``` 
  
  A more detailed list with information on arguments can be found [here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api-cmd.html).
  
 ### C Code
 Example C code can be found [here](https://github.com/slockit/in3-c/tree/master/examples/c)
 ```c
#include <in3/client.h>    // the core client
#include <in3/eth_basic.h> // use the basic module
#include <in3/in3_curl.h>  // transport implementation
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // register a chain-verifier for basic Ethereum-Support, which is enough to verify blocks
  in3_register_eth_basic();

  in3_register_curl(); // use curl as the default for sending out requests

  in3_t* in3 = in3_new(); // create new incubed client
 
  char *result, *error;  // prepare 2 pointers for the result.

  in3_ret_t res = in3_client_rpc(   // send raw rpc-request, which is then verified
      in3,                    //  the configured client
      "eth_getBlockByNumber", // the rpc-method you want to call.
      "[\"latest\",true]",    // the arguments as json-string
      &result,                // the reference to a pointer whill hold the result
      &error);                // the pointer which may hold a error message

  if (res == IN3_OK) {
    printf("Latest block : \n%s\n", result);
    free(result);
  } else {
    printf("Error verifing the Latest block : \n%s\n", error);
    free(error);
  }
  in3_free(in3);   // cleanup client after usage

}
 ```
 A more detailed example with information on how to call functions can be found [here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api-c.html#examples).
